    What is the best email tracking app?
</h2>
<p dir="ltr">
    Email tracking is an essential for any business. However, it can be
    difficult to determine which email tracking app is best for your needs. To
    help make the decision easier, we’ve compiled a list of quick tips for
    better email tracking.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    1. Use a tool that your team is familiar with. If you’re using a tool that
    your team is unfamiliar with, they may not be as diligent about logging
    their emails and tracking their analytics. Choose an email tracking tool
    that your team is comfortable using, so they are more likely to use it
    regularly.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    2. Set up daily or weekly reporting. Email tracking should be used to
    measure progress and goals, not just to keep track of daily activity. Make
    sure to set up daily or weekly reporting to see how your email campaigns
    are performing overall and what areas need improvement.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    3. Track open and click-through rates (CTRs). One of the most important
    stats to track when it comes to email marketing is CTR. Open and
    click-through rates tell you how many people have opened and clicked
    through your emails, respectively. This information can help you determine
    the effectiveness of your campaigns and what areas need improvement. If
    your CTR is low, it means that you aren't sending out a lot of emails to
    the right people or that you're not providing enough valuable content in
    your emails.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    4. Test and measure (the F9 feature). Use the "F9" button to send an email
    campaign without clicking anywhere else on your website. This is a great
    way to see how recipients are responding to different types of content
    within an email and can help determine which pieces work best for specific
    campaigns.
